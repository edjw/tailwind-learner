# Tailwind learner

Basic Tailwind setup with a single static HTML file

`npm i live-server`

Only use the `watch` and `start` script if you want to watch changes to the tailwind css file.

Most of the time just use the `serve` script and edit classes in the HTML file

Good extensions are Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, Tailwind Docs, Headwind, and PostCSS Language Support
